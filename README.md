# TrajectoryDisplay

This project has been extracted from a larger project in order to showcase rendering a trajectory arc for players who are holding a throwable item in Minecraft.
It is not up to date with current Minecraft specs, it is not expected to compile in its current state, due to it being an older version of the larger project.

Examples of this project in action can be seen here:
